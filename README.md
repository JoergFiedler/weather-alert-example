Nothing fancy.

Sample project to demonstrate how to use [here.com Weather API](https://developer.here.com/rest-apis/documentation/weather/topics/user-guide.html) using Angular.

This is a gulp based project. So please make sure you have {node|io}js installed.

Run the following command and follow the instructions on the screen.

    npm install
    npm install -g gulp-cli
    gulp

The app looks terrible, because there is no css-styling yet.

There is a single test in `test/js/controller` to demostrate how it works. Usually I write some more tests, but due time constraints I skipped them today.
